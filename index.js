// Node is just a run-time environment, not a language
// Node allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser
// This means we can use Node to build:
// Desktop apps
// CLIs (Command Line Interfaces)
// Web Servers (What we care most about in our full stack course)

// Writing an Node app is simple
// Just use JavaScript!
console.log('I write Node applications using JavaScript');

// How to run this command
// 1. Open terminal where file is located
// 2. Type `$ node index` (remember you can leave off the ".js" extension)
